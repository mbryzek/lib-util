/** The Jackson family this build resolves is pinned in build.sbt rather than inherited, and every
  * part of that pin fails silently when it is wrong.
  *
  * A partial pin resolves cleanly and then refuses at runtime: jackson-module-scala checks its
  * databind version when it registers and throws "Scala module <v> requires Jackson Databind
  * version >= <x> and < <y>", which in an application surfaces as an injector that builds no
  * object mapper rather than as a version conflict.
  *
  * A pin that slips below 2.15.0 resolves cleanly too, and jackson-core there parses nesting to
  * whatever depth the input asks for -- so a deeply nested document exhausts the stack instead of
  * being rejected (GHSA-h46c-h94j-95f3). The depth limit that replaced it is what the second
  * assertion observes; the exception type it throws did not exist before the fix.
  *
  * A pin below 2.18.8, or on 2.19.0 through 2.21.3, is the quietest of the three, because there
  * the configuration that is supposed to stop an attack reports that it is in force and is not. A
  * type id carrying generics is validated by the substring before the `<` alone; databind then
  * parses the whole canonical string and resolves the arguments out of the rest of it without
  * offering them to the `PolymorphicTypeValidator` at all. An allow-list naming one safe container
  * therefore admits any type smuggled into that container's parameter position, which is
  * instantiated and has its properties set from the document (GHSA-j3rv-43j4-c7qm). Nothing throws
  * and nothing is logged -- the deserialization simply succeeds where it was configured not to,
  * which is why the third assertion offers a denied type through a parameter and asks for the
  * refusal, rather than reading a version number back.
