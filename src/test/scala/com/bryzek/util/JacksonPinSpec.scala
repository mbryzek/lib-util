/** The Jackson family this build resolves is pinned in build.sbt rather than inherited, and both
  * halves of that pin fail silently when they are wrong.
  *
  * A partial pin resolves cleanly and then refuses at runtime: jackson-module-scala checks its
  * databind version when it registers and throws "Scala module <v> requires Jackson Databind
  * version >= <x> and < <y>", which in an application surfaces as an injector that builds no
  * object mapper rather than as a version conflict.
  *
  * A pin that slips below 2.15.0 resolves cleanly too, and jackson-core there parses nesting to
  * whatever depth the input asks for -- so a deeply nested document exhausts the stack instead of
  * being rejected (GHSA-h46c-h94j-95f3). The depth limit that replaced it is what the second
  * assertion observes; the exception type it throws did not exist before the fix.
  *
  * A pin that slips anywhere below 2.18.8, or onto the 2.19-2.21.3 line, resolves cleanly and
  * passes both of the assertions above, because the depth limit they observe shipped in 2.15.0.
  * What it reintroduces is GHSA-r7wm-3cxj-wff9: the non-blocking parser applies maxNumberLength to
  * the digits in each fed chunk rather than to the number accumulated across feeds, so a value
  * split across `feedInput` calls is not bounded at all and no chunk ever has to exceed the limit.
  * The third assertion is the one that separates a fixed line from a merely-nesting-safe one.
