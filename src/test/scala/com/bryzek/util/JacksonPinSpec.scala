/** The Jackson family this build resolves is pinned in build.sbt rather than inherited, and every
  * part of that pin fails silently when it is wrong.
  *
  * A partial pin resolves cleanly and then refuses at runtime: jackson-module-scala checks its
  * databind version when it registers and throws "Scala module <v> requires Jackson Databind
  * version >= <x> and < <y>", which in an application surfaces as an injector that builds no
  * object mapper rather than as a version conflict.
  *
  * A pin that slips below 2.15.0 resolves cleanly too, and jackson-core there parses nesting to
  * whatever depth the input asks for -- so a deeply nested document exhausts the stack instead of
  * being rejected (GHSA-h46c-h94j-95f3). The depth limit that replaced it is what the second
  * assertion observes; the exception type it throws did not exist before the fix.
  *
  * A pin below 2.18.8, or on 2.19.0 through 2.21.3, resolves cleanly and passes both of the
  * assertions above, because the depth limit they observe shipped in 2.15.0. Two advisories share
  * that range -- one against databind, one against core -- and the third and fourth assertions
  * take one each. Neither can be read off a version number: both are behaviour of a limit that is
  * configured, reported as in force, and not applied.
  *
  * The databind one is the quieter, because there the configuration that is supposed to stop an
  * attack reports that it is in force and is not. A type id carrying generics is validated by the
  * substring before the `<` alone; databind then parses the whole canonical string and resolves
  * the arguments out of the rest of it without offering them to the `PolymorphicTypeValidator` at
  * all. An allow-list naming one safe container therefore admits any type smuggled into that
  * container's parameter position, which is instantiated and has its properties set from the
  * document (GHSA-j3rv-43j4-c7qm). Nothing throws and nothing is logged -- the deserialization
  * simply succeeds where it was configured not to, which is why the third assertion offers a
  * denied type through a parameter and asks for the refusal, rather than reading a version number
  * back.
  *
  * The core one is the same shape one layer down: the non-blocking parser applies maxNumberLength
  * to the digits in each fed chunk rather than to the number accumulated across feeds, so a value
  * split across `feedInput` calls is not bounded at all and no chunk ever has to exceed the limit
  * (GHSA-r7wm-3cxj-wff9). The fourth assertion feeds one number in pieces and asks for the
  * refusal.
