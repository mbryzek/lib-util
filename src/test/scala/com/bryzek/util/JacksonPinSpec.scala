/** The Jackson family this build resolves is pinned in build.sbt rather than inherited, and both
  * halves of that pin fail silently when they are wrong.
  *
  * A partial pin resolves cleanly and then refuses at runtime: jackson-module-scala checks its
  * databind version when it registers and throws "Scala module <v> requires Jackson Databind
  * version >= <x> and < <y>", which in an application surfaces as an injector that builds no
  * object mapper rather than as a version conflict.
  *
  * A pin that slips below 2.15.0 resolves cleanly too, and jackson-core there parses nesting to
  * whatever depth the input asks for -- so a deeply nested document exhausts the stack instead of
  * being rejected (GHSA-h46c-h94j-95f3). The depth limit that replaced it is what the second
  * assertion observes; the exception type it throws did not exist before the fix.
