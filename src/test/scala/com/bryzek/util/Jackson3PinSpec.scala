/** Jackson 3 -- the `tools.jackson` artifacts -- is pinned in build.sbt rather than inherited from
  * logstash-logback-encoder, and a pin that slips below the floor resolves cleanly and says
  * nothing.
  *
  * Neither of the two advisories that set that floor can be read off a version number: each is the
  * behaviour of a limit that is configured, reported as in force, and not applied.
  *
  * The core one is in the non-blocking parser. `maxNumberLength` was applied to the digits within
  * each chunk fed to it rather than to the number accumulated across feeds, so a value split
  * across `feedInput` calls was not bounded at all and no chunk ever had to exceed the limit
  * (GHSA-r7wm-3cxj-wff9). The first assertion feeds one number in pieces and asks for the refusal.
  *
  * The databind one is the quieter, because there the configuration that is supposed to stop a
  * write reports that it is in force and is not. `@JsonView` is a write gate: an endpoint binds an
  * untrusted body under a public view and groups privileged state in a property that names a
  * privileged one. Where that property is also `@JsonUnwrapped`, the buffered JSON was replayed
  * into it without ever asking whether the property is visible in the active view, so an untrusted
  * caller mass-assigned it (GHSA-5gvw-p9qm-jgwh). The second assertion binds a document naming a
  * privileged field under the public view and asks for it to be left alone -- and reads the same
  * document under the privileged view first, because a property Jackson never discovered would
  * leave the container null for the wrong reason and pass.
