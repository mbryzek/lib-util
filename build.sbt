// Every Jackson artifact in this build resolves to one version, in every configuration, and the
// published POM says so.
//
// Jackson's own compatibility rule is that a release train moves together: the datatype and
// dataformat modules compile against databind's internal serializer/deserializer SPI, and
// jackson-module-scala additionally asserts its databind version at runtime and refuses to run
// outside its own minor line. Only that last one fails loudly; a module left behind on an older
// line links fine and throws AbstractMethodError or NoSuchMethodError on whichever serializer path
// first touches a changed SPI method, whenever something first exercises it. So a pin that names
// only the vulnerable coordinate trades an advisory for a latent linkage error.
//
// The whole family arrives transitively at ONE version and has to leave at one: play-json
// contributes core/annotations/databind/datatype-jdk8/datatype-jsr310, and play (via
// scalatestplus-play) contributes dataformat-cbor/module-parameter-names/module-scala through
// pekko-serialization-jackson. That version is inside the affected range of GHSA-r7wm-3cxj-wff9,
// where jackson-core's non-blocking parser applies maxNumberLength to the digits in each fed chunk
// rather than to the number accumulated across feeds, so a value split across feedInput calls is
// never bounded at all. play-json 3.0.6 is its newest release and still declares the vulnerable
// version, so there is no upstream release to move to and the coordinates have to be named here.
//
// TWO STATEMENTS, TWO JOBS, and neither one does the other's:
//
//   dependencyOverrides is resolution-local. It settles every configuration of THIS build, the
//   artifacts that only ever reach the test classpath included, and writes nothing into the
//   published POM.
//
//   libraryDependencies is what a consumer sees. Declaring, at compile scope, each artifact this
//   library already exports transitively is what makes a consumer resolve the fixed version
//   instead of inheriting the vulnerable one through the play-json edge from a library that reads
//   as fixed.
//
// 2.22.2 rather than the advisory's own 2.18.8 floor: both are out of range, and 2.22.2 is what
// platform and acumen already pin, so the Jackson this library's tests resolve is the one its
// consumers actually run and the next dependency sweep has nothing to bump.
//
// jackson-annotations publishes no patch versions on its 2.20+ lines (maven-metadata.xml runs
// 2.19.4, 2.20, 2.21, 2.22), so it carries its own version and a patch number there is a 404 that
// fails the whole resolution.

// Keep the unused browser-automation stack off the test classpath.

// It arrives by two transitive routes -- play-test -> io.fluentlenium:fluentlenium-core, and
// scalatestplus-play -> org.seleniumhq.selenium:htmlunit-driver -> net.sourceforge.htmlunit --
// and each of the four packages underneath carries an open high or critical advisory:
// net.sourceforge.htmlunit:htmlunit, org.eclipse.jetty 9.4 (htmlunit's websocket client),
// org.codehaus.plexus:plexus-utils (fluentlenium's maven-model) and io.appium:java-client.
// The worst of them cannot be bumped: net.sourceforge.htmlunit:htmlunit has no release above
// 2.70.0, because the fix shipped under a renamed coordinate (org.htmlunit:htmlunit 3.0.0) that
// nothing on this classpath resolves. Excluding is the only remediation in our hands until
// play-test and htmlunit-driver move to it.
//
// org.seleniumhq.selenium IS DELIBERATELY LEFT ALONE, and htmlunit-driver with it. `play.api.test
// .PlayRunners` -- which `play.api.test.Helpers` extends, and which every GuiceOneServerPerSuite
// spec initializes on its way to starting a test server -- holds `val HTMLUNIT =
// classOf[HtmlUnitDriver]` and `val FIREFOX = classOf[FirefoxDriver]` as class literals, so both
// driver classes must RESOLVE or Helpers' static initializer throws NoClassDefFoundError and
// every server-per-suite spec dies before its first assertion. Resolving them needs only their
// own supertypes, which are all Selenium; neither loads anything from net.sourceforge.htmlunit.
// None of the Selenium artifacts carries an open advisory.
//
// What does go is genuinely unreferenced: the only play-test classes naming fluentlenium are
// TestBrowser and WebDriverFactory, and nothing here constructs a WebDriver, extends a
// scalatestplus-play browser trait, or uses anything from it beyond PlaySpec,
// GuiceOneAppPerSuite and GuiceOneServerPerSuite. A browser test written after this fails to
// link, loudly, at the moment it is written -- which is the intended trade: add a maintained
// stack (org.htmlunit, or Playwright) rather than inherit a stale one through a transitive.

// `-feature` is what makes a `-Werror` failure name the construct, the file and the line.
// Without it the compiler says only "there was 1 feature warning; re-run with -feature",
// and the `ci` log is the only artifact that run leaves -- nobody can re-run it
// interactively. Order below is the two general flags, then the `-W` set alphabetically,
// so a new option has one obvious place to go.
//
// `-Wvalue-discard` (E175) and `-Wnonunit-statement` (E176) are here for ONE class of silent
// bug: a computation that produced a value carrying its own outcome -- a `Future` nobody
// awaited, an `Either`/`Try`/`ValidatedNec` nobody inspected -- thrown away, so the code
// compiles, runs and reports success while the work it stands for never happened. Fixing one
// means HANDLING the value: await it, fold it, bind it, return it. Adapting it to `Unit`
// re-hides the exact thing the flag found, so it is not a fix.
//
// RAISED ON THE VALUE'S TYPE, NOT ON EVERY STATEMENT, and the three `-Wconf` lines below are
// how. Bare, the pair fires on every statement whose value goes unused: a `mutable.Map#put`
// returning the entry it displaced, a Java builder returning itself, a generated DAO `insert`
// returning the row it just wrote, a ScalaTest matcher returning the `Assertion` it has already
// thrown on. None of those is a dropped result, and none of them has any remedy other than the
// `: Unit` ascription this rule forbids -- so the two ids are silenced, then re-raised for the
// types where a discard IS the defect. Re-raised as an ERROR rather than a warning, so the gate
// does not depend on `-Werror` staying on above it.
//
// ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING: a later `-Wconf` rule beats an earlier one, so the sequence is
// silence-then-raise and never the reverse. Growing the gate means adding a type to the last
// line; deleting the two silencing lines is not the same thing and never was -- it surfaces
// tens of thousands of statements whose only legal fix this rule has ruled out.
//
// `-Xlint` IS NOT IN THIS SET, and its Scala 3 replacement is why. The option is Scala 2's;
// Scala 3 deprecates it and schedules it for removal, pointing at `-Wshadow` instead -- and
// `-Wshadow` fires on a constructor parameter forwarded to a base class that re-exposes it as a
// `val` of the same name, which is the only spelling that relationship has. Its remedy is a
// worse parameter name at every named-argument call site, so the lint costs more than the
// shadowing it reports.
