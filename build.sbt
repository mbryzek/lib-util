// Every Jackson artifact in this build resolves to one version.
//
// Jackson's own compatibility rule is that a release train moves together: the datatype and
// dataformat modules compile against databind's internal serializer/deserializer SPI, and
// jackson-module-scala additionally asserts its databind version at runtime and refuses to
// register outside its own minor line. Only that last one fails loudly; a datatype module left
// behind on an older line links fine and throws AbstractMethodError or NoSuchMethodError on
// whichever serializer path first touches a changed SPI method. `JacksonPinSpec` asserts the pair
// registers, so a partial bump fails by name here rather than opaquely in a consumer.
//
// Drift is the default here rather than an accident. play-json and pekko-serialization-jackson
// contribute the whole family transitively at one version, so pinning a single coordinate wins the
// conflict only for that artifact and the ones it depends on, leaving cbor/jdk8/jsr310/
// parameter-names behind. Overriding the whole family is what makes one version true of all of
// them.
//
// The floor is a security one and four advisories set it, so it is stated as a range rather than a
// single number. jackson-core below 2.15.0 has no nesting-depth limit and throws StackOverflowError
// on deeply nested input rather than rejecting it (GHSA-h46c-h94j-95f3), and that is the version
// play-json resolves. jackson-databind below 2.18.8 -- and again on 2.19.0 through 2.21.3 --
// validates a type id carrying generics by the substring before the `<` and then resolves the type
// arguments out of the rest of it without ever offering them to the PolymorphicTypeValidator, so an
// allow-list naming one safe container admits any type smuggled into that container's parameter
// position (GHSA-j3rv-43j4-c7qm). Databind over that same range also answers
// `allowIfSubTypeIsArray` on `clazz.isArray()` alone and never validates the array's component
// type, so a denied class named as the element of an array is admitted and instantiated with no
// further check (GHSA-rmj7-2vxq-3g9f). jackson-core over that same range applies maxNumberLength to
// the digits within each chunk fed to the non-blocking parser rather than to the number accumulated
// across feeds, so a number split across `feedInput` calls is not bounded at all and no chunk ever
// has to exceed the limit (GHSA-r7wm-3cxj-wff9).
//
// The last three are the binding ones -- they share one range -- and they are why the first is not
// the number to read off this comment: they rule out the whole 2.15.0-2.18.7 span the nesting-depth
// floor would allow, so the lowest this pin may state is 2.18.8, and anything chosen on the 2.19
// line must be 2.21.4 or above. 2.22.2 is the head of the Jackson 2 line and the version platform
// and acumen pin, so a consumer that pins too resolves one Jackson rather than two.
//
// This governs THIS build's resolution only -- sbt writes no `dependencyOverrides` into the
// published POM -- so it decides what this repo compiles and tests against and imposes no floor on
// a consumer. A consumer states its own, as platform and acumen do.
//
// jackson-annotations publishes no patch versions on its 2.20+ lines (maven-metadata.xml runs
// 2.19.4, 2.20, 2.21, 2.22), so it carries its own version and a patch number there is a 404 that
// fails the whole resolution.

// Keep the unused browser-automation stack off the test classpath.

// It arrives by two transitive routes -- play-test -> io.fluentlenium:fluentlenium-core, and
// scalatestplus-play -> org.seleniumhq.selenium:htmlunit-driver -> net.sourceforge.htmlunit --
// and each of the four packages underneath carries an open high or critical advisory:
// net.sourceforge.htmlunit:htmlunit, org.eclipse.jetty 9.4 (htmlunit's websocket client),
// org.codehaus.plexus:plexus-utils (fluentlenium's maven-model) and io.appium:java-client.
// The worst of them cannot be bumped: net.sourceforge.htmlunit:htmlunit has no release above
// 2.70.0, because the fix shipped under a renamed coordinate (org.htmlunit:htmlunit 3.0.0) that
// nothing on this classpath resolves. Excluding is the only remediation in our hands until
// play-test and htmlunit-driver move to it.
//
// org.seleniumhq.selenium IS DELIBERATELY LEFT ALONE, and htmlunit-driver with it. `play.api.test
// .PlayRunners` -- which `play.api.test.Helpers` extends, and which every GuiceOneServerPerSuite
// spec initializes on its way to starting a test server -- holds `val HTMLUNIT =
// classOf[HtmlUnitDriver]` and `val FIREFOX = classOf[FirefoxDriver]` as class literals, so both
// driver classes must RESOLVE or Helpers' static initializer throws NoClassDefFoundError and
// every server-per-suite spec dies before its first assertion. Resolving them needs only their
// own supertypes, which are all Selenium; neither loads anything from net.sourceforge.htmlunit.
// None of the Selenium artifacts carries an open advisory.
//
// What does go is genuinely unreferenced: the only play-test classes naming fluentlenium are
// TestBrowser and WebDriverFactory, and nothing here constructs a WebDriver, extends a
// scalatestplus-play browser trait, or uses anything from it beyond PlaySpec,
// GuiceOneAppPerSuite and GuiceOneServerPerSuite. A browser test written after this fails to
// link, loudly, at the moment it is written -- which is the intended trade: add a maintained
// stack (org.htmlunit, or Playwright) rather than inherit a stale one through a transitive.

// `-feature` is what makes a `-Werror` failure name the construct, the file and the line.
// Without it the compiler says only "there was 1 feature warning; re-run with -feature",
// and the `ci` log is the only artifact that run leaves -- nobody can re-run it
// interactively. Order below is the two general flags, then the `-W` set alphabetically,
// so a new option has one obvious place to go.
//
// `-Wvalue-discard` (E175) and `-Wnonunit-statement` (E176) are here for ONE class of silent
// bug: a computation that produced a value carrying its own outcome -- a `Future` nobody
// awaited, an `Either`/`Try`/`ValidatedNec` nobody inspected -- thrown away, so the code
// compiles, runs and reports success while the work it stands for never happened. Fixing one
// means HANDLING the value: await it, fold it, bind it, return it. Adapting it to `Unit`
// re-hides the exact thing the flag found, so it is not a fix.
//
// RAISED ON THE VALUE'S TYPE, NOT ON EVERY STATEMENT, and the three `-Wconf` lines below are
// how. Bare, the pair fires on every statement whose value goes unused: a `mutable.Map#put`
// returning the entry it displaced, a Java builder returning itself, a generated DAO `insert`
// returning the row it just wrote, a ScalaTest matcher returning the `Assertion` it has already
// thrown on. None of those is a dropped result, and none of them has any remedy other than the
// `: Unit` ascription this rule forbids -- so the two ids are silenced, then re-raised for the
// types where a discard IS the defect. Re-raised as an ERROR rather than a warning, so the gate
// does not depend on `-Werror` staying on above it.
//
// ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING: a later `-Wconf` rule beats an earlier one, so the sequence is
// silence-then-raise and never the reverse. Growing the gate means adding a type to the last
// line; deleting the two silencing lines is not the same thing and never was -- it surfaces
// tens of thousands of statements whose only legal fix this rule has ruled out.
//
// `-Xlint` IS NOT IN THIS SET, and its Scala 3 replacement is why. The option is Scala 2's;
// Scala 3 deprecates it and schedules it for removal, pointing at `-Wshadow` instead -- and
// `-Wshadow` fires on a constructor parameter forwarded to a base class that re-exposes it as a
// `val` of the same name, which is the only spelling that relationship has. Its remedy is a
// worse parameter name at every named-argument call site, so the lint costs more than the
// shadowing it reports.
