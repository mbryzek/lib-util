// Every Jackson artifact in this build resolves to one version, out of the range of
// GHSA-rmj7-2vxq-3g9f -- where BasicPolymorphicTypeValidator's `allowIfSubTypeIsArray` check is
// bypassed by naming an array of a forbidden type, so polymorphic deserialization accepts a subtype
// the allowlist was written to refuse. Jackson reaches this build only transitively, through
// play-json, and play-json 3.0.6 is its newest release -- so there is no upstream version to move
// to and Jackson has to be named here.
//
// DECLARED AT COMPILE SCOPE, NOT `dependencyOverrides`. An override is resolution-local: it fixes
// this build's classpath and writes nothing into the published POM, so every consumer would keep
// resolving the affected version through the play-json edge and inherit the advisory from a library
// that reads as fixed. A direct compile-scope dependency is what reaches them. The three artifacts
// under `dependencyOverrides` below are on the TEST classpath only, reach no consumer, and are
// pinned rather than declared so they stay out of the POM.
//
// ONE VERSION FOR THE WHOLE FAMILY, not just jackson-databind. jackson-module-scala asserts its
// databind version at runtime and refuses to register against a databind whose minor is not its
// own, so a build where the two drift boots no Guice-backed Play app at all -- which is every
// scalatestplus-play spec in this repo -- and the datatype modules are compiled against databind's
// SPI, which moves with it.
//
// 2.22.2 rather than the advisory's own 2.18.8 floor: both are out of range, and 2.22.2 is what
// platform and acumen already pin, so the Jackson this library resolves is the one its consumers
// actually run and the next dependency sweep has nothing to bump. jackson-annotations publishes no
// patch versions on its 2.20+ lines (maven-metadata.xml runs 2.19.4, 2.20, 2.21, 2.22), so it
// carries its own version and a patch number there is a 404 that fails the whole resolution.

// Keep the unused browser-automation stack off the test classpath.

// It arrives by two transitive routes -- play-test -> io.fluentlenium:fluentlenium-core, and
// scalatestplus-play -> org.seleniumhq.selenium:htmlunit-driver -> net.sourceforge.htmlunit --
// and each of the four packages underneath carries an open high or critical advisory:
// net.sourceforge.htmlunit:htmlunit, org.eclipse.jetty 9.4 (htmlunit's websocket client),
// org.codehaus.plexus:plexus-utils (fluentlenium's maven-model) and io.appium:java-client.
// The worst of them cannot be bumped: net.sourceforge.htmlunit:htmlunit has no release above
// 2.70.0, because the fix shipped under a renamed coordinate (org.htmlunit:htmlunit 3.0.0) that
// nothing on this classpath resolves. Excluding is the only remediation in our hands until
// play-test and htmlunit-driver move to it.
//
// org.seleniumhq.selenium IS DELIBERATELY LEFT ALONE, and htmlunit-driver with it. `play.api.test
// .PlayRunners` -- which `play.api.test.Helpers` extends, and which every GuiceOneServerPerSuite
// spec initializes on its way to starting a test server -- holds `val HTMLUNIT =
// classOf[HtmlUnitDriver]` and `val FIREFOX = classOf[FirefoxDriver]` as class literals, so both
// driver classes must RESOLVE or Helpers' static initializer throws NoClassDefFoundError and
// every server-per-suite spec dies before its first assertion. Resolving them needs only their
// own supertypes, which are all Selenium; neither loads anything from net.sourceforge.htmlunit.
// None of the Selenium artifacts carries an open advisory.
//
// What does go is genuinely unreferenced: the only play-test classes naming fluentlenium are
// TestBrowser and WebDriverFactory, and nothing here constructs a WebDriver, extends a
// scalatestplus-play browser trait, or uses anything from it beyond PlaySpec,
// GuiceOneAppPerSuite and GuiceOneServerPerSuite. A browser test written after this fails to
// link, loudly, at the moment it is written -- which is the intended trade: add a maintained
// stack (org.htmlunit, or Playwright) rather than inherit a stale one through a transitive.

// `-feature` is what makes a `-Werror` failure name the construct, the file and the line.
// Without it the compiler says only "there was 1 feature warning; re-run with -feature",
// and the `ci` log is the only artifact that run leaves -- nobody can re-run it
// interactively. Order below is the two general flags, then the `-W` set alphabetically,
// so a new option has one obvious place to go.
//
// `-Wvalue-discard` (E175) and `-Wnonunit-statement` (E176) are here for ONE class of silent
// bug: a computation that produced a value carrying its own outcome -- a `Future` nobody
// awaited, an `Either`/`Try`/`ValidatedNec` nobody inspected -- thrown away, so the code
// compiles, runs and reports success while the work it stands for never happened. Fixing one
// means HANDLING the value: await it, fold it, bind it, return it. Adapting it to `Unit`
// re-hides the exact thing the flag found, so it is not a fix.
//
// RAISED ON THE VALUE'S TYPE, NOT ON EVERY STATEMENT, and the three `-Wconf` lines below are
// how. Bare, the pair fires on every statement whose value goes unused: a `mutable.Map#put`
// returning the entry it displaced, a Java builder returning itself, a generated DAO `insert`
// returning the row it just wrote, a ScalaTest matcher returning the `Assertion` it has already
// thrown on. None of those is a dropped result, and none of them has any remedy other than the
// `: Unit` ascription this rule forbids -- so the two ids are silenced, then re-raised for the
// types where a discard IS the defect. Re-raised as an ERROR rather than a warning, so the gate
// does not depend on `-Werror` staying on above it.
//
// ORDER IS LOAD-BEARING: a later `-Wconf` rule beats an earlier one, so the sequence is
// silence-then-raise and never the reverse. Growing the gate means adding a type to the last
// line; deleting the two silencing lines is not the same thing and never was -- it surfaces
// tens of thousands of statements whose only legal fix this rule has ruled out.
//
// `-Xlint` IS NOT IN THIS SET, and its Scala 3 replacement is why. The option is Scala 2's;
// Scala 3 deprecates it and schedules it for removal, pointing at `-Wshadow` instead -- and
// `-Wshadow` fires on a constructor parameter forwarded to a base class that re-exposes it as a
// `val` of the same name, which is the only spelling that relationship has. Its remedy is a
// worse parameter name at every named-argument call site, so the lint costs more than the
// shadowing it reports.
